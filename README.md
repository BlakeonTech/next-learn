# Learn Next.js

This is a personal test project exploring Next.js and Vercel deployments as part of a Customer Success application with Vercel.

## Contributions

The code for the example apps you build using Next.js Learn live in this repository and we'd be grateful for your contributions.

The course curriculum is currently not open sourced, but you can [create an issue](https://github.com/vercel/next-learn/issues/new) if you find a mistake.
